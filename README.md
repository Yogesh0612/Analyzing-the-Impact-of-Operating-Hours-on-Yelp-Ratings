# Analyzing-the-Impact-of-Operating-Hours-on-Yelp-Ratings
Introduction:
In this data-driven exploration, I embarked on a fascinating journey to uncover the nuanced relationship between operating hours and Yelp ratings for a restaurant. Leveraging my skills in Python, SQL, and data integration, I seamlessly combined data from Yelp and the Google Maps API to shed light on the impact of operational timings on customer perceptions.

Data Integration:

Python and SQL Integration:

I facilitated a smooth data integration process by merging data from Yelp using Python within a SQL Workbench environment. This ensured a cohesive dataset that incorporated essential information from Yelp reviews.
GMaps API for Operating Hours:

Recognizing the significance of operating hours, I sourced this critical data from the Google Maps API. This allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the temporal aspect of customer experiences.
Project Workflow:

Data Retrieval:

Implemented Python scripts to fetch and integrate Yelp data into SQL Workbench. Utilized SQL queries to transform and structure the dataset for analysis.
GMaps API Integration:

Extracted operating hours data from the Google Maps API, seamlessly integrating it with the Yelp dataset to create a unified source of information.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Leveraged Python's data analysis libraries for EDA, unraveling patterns and trends related to operating hours and Yelp ratings.
Statistical Analysis:

Applied statistical techniques to discern correlations and inferential insights regarding the influence of operating hours on Yelp ratings.
Key Findings:

Temporal Trends:

Identified trends in customer ratings based on the time of day and day of the week, unraveling the temporal dynamics of customer satisfaction.
Peak Operational Hours:

Determined optimal operating hours that correlate with higher Yelp ratings, providing actionable insights for restaurant management.
